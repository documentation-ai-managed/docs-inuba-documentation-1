## Best Practices for Documentation

Follow these guidelines to create effective docs.

| Practice | Description | Benefit |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Use Components | Integrate `<Callout>`, `<Steps>`, and `<Tabs>` for rich content. | Improves readability and engagement. |
| Version Control | Enable Git integration in project settings. | Tracks changes and enables rollbacks. |
| Consistent Structure | Start pages with frontmatter, use H2 headings, and end with CTAs. | Enhances navigation and SEO. |

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="How do you organize large docs?">

    Create a clear hierarchy: Use H2 for sections, H3 for subsections. Group related pages in folders.

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Root] --> B[Guides]
        A --> C[API Reference]
        A --> D[FAQ]
        B --> E[Quickstart]
        B --> F[Troubleshooting]
    ```

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="What's the best way to add code examples?">

    Use `<CodeGroup>` for multi-language support.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
      ```javascript
      const client = new InubaClient({ apiKey: 'your-key' });
      const docs = await client.getDocs();
      console.log(docs);
      ```
      ```python
      from inuba import Client
      client = Client(api_key="your-key")
      docs = client.get_docs()
